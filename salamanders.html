        <h1>Salamanders</h1>
        <h2>Hellbenders</h2>
        <p>Inhabiting only two of New York State's river drainages, the eastern hellbender is an intriguing and bizarre animal and hails as the Americas' largest aquatic salamander. Sexually mature adult hellbenders range in size from 12-29 inches and vary in color from grayish to olive brown and occasionally entirely black. Individuals usually sport dark mottling over the back and upper sides. Several loose flaps of thick, wrinkled skin, which serve a respiratory function, run laterally along either side of the animal. These salamanders are perfectly adapted to their swift flowing stream habitats with their flattened head and body, short stout legs, long rudderlike tail, and very small beady eyes.</p>

        <h2>Red Spotted Newt</h2>
        <p>The eastern newt, also known as the red-spotted newt, is a fascinating salamander native to the eastern United States. You'll often spot them in or near ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, as they require a freshwater habitat. What makes this species truly unique is its three-stage life cycle. It starts as an aquatic larva, then transitions to a terrestrial juvenile, known as the eft, which can be bright orange or red. This eft stage is a fun fact: it can last for several years! Finally, it matures into an aquatic adult, returning to the water to live out the rest of its life. This dual existence, both on land and in the water, makes the red-spotted newt a remarkable creature of the American wilderness</p>
