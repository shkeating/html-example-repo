       <h1>Spiders</h1>
        <p>"We help out!"</p>
        <p>Spiders may be small but their contribution to the ecosystem is grand. Without spiders many small insects would grow in immeasurable numbers. Imagine how many flies there might be buzzing around! And without these little predators, birds would lose a food source and many birds we love and treasure could decrease greatly in number without spiders. These little guys are great hou. semates too! Spiders in the corners of rooms keep moths and other small bugs out of your way. But if you don't enjoy such a creepy critter in your own home, please put them outside (carefully). If you don't bother them, they won't bother you.</p>
        <p>(Please be weary with any spiders you know to be dangerous. Below there is a list of spiders that are actually dangerous.)</p>
